# CONTEXT.md Format

Mirrored from [mattpocock/skills — grill-with-docs/CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/grill-with-docs/CONTEXT-FORMAT.md). Adopted as the IssueFlow standard.

## Structure

```md
# {Context Name}

{One or two sentence description of what this context is and why it exists.}

## Language

**Order**:
{A one or two sentence description of the term}
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction

**Invoice**:
A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery.
_Avoid_: Bill, payment request
```

## Rules

- **Be opinionated.** When multiple words exist for the same concept, pick the best one and list the others under `_Avoid_`.
- **Keep definitions tight.** One or two sentences max. Define what it IS, not what it does.
- **Only include terms specific to this project's context.** General programming concepts (timeouts, error types, utility patterns) don't belong even if the project uses them extensively. Before adding a term, ask: is this a concept unique to this context, or a general programming concept? Only the former belongs.
- **Group terms under subheadings** when natural clusters emerge. If all terms belong to a single cohesive area, a flat list is fine.

## Single vs multi-context repos

**Single context (most repos):** One `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root.

**Multiple contexts:** A `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root lists the contexts, where they live, and how they relate to each other.

IssueFlow is currently single-context — see `/CONTEXT.md`.
